    "# 🧱 Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this notebook on **tokenization**, the essential first step that turns raw text into something a model can actually work with. Before any language model can “understand” text, the text must be broken into tokens: characters, subwords, or other meaningful units. How we choose to do that has a huge impact on model performance, vocabulary size, efficiency, and even how well the model handles rare or creative language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll explore tokenization from the ground up:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔤 Starting with raw bytes  \n",
    "- 🧩 Building up to subword methods like **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**  \n",
    "- ⚠️ Examining common pitfalls and weird edge cases  \n",
    "- 🔍 Investigating how different snippets of text get tokenized in practice  \n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, you’ll experiment, compare techniques, and uncover the surprising ways models “see” text. By the end, you’ll not only understand how modern tokenizers work, you’ll be able to build and analyze your own.\n",

    "## 🌟 Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve already seen that tokenization is about breaking text into pieces a model can understand. But language is huge and unpredictable: new words, names, typos, different spellings. If we tried to create a token for *every* word, our vocabulary would be enormous… and still fail on words we haven’t seen! 😅\n",
    "\n",
    "**Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** offers a clever fix. Instead of learning whole words, BPE learns **subword units**, ie. frequent chunks that can be combined to form any word. This gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔤 **Complete coverage:** Even brand-new words can be built from familiar subwords.  \n",
    "- 📦 **Smaller vocabulary:** Less memory, faster models, cleaner representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 The big idea  \n",
    "Start with characters → repeatedly merge the most common pair → build bigger and bigger chunks. Over time, the tokenizer “discovers” useful patterns like roots, prefixes, and common letter combos.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to implement this algorithm. In this section, we will build together, a very simple version of it just for the purpose of understanding how it works and seeing it in action.\n",
