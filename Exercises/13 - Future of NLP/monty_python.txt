Scene 1

       [clop clop]
   ARTHUR:  Whoa there!
       [clop clop]
  
   GUARD #1:  Halt!  Who goes there?
   ARTHUR:  It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle
       of Camelot.  King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign
       of all England!
   GUARD #1:  Pull the other one!
   ARTHUR:  I am.  And this my trusty servant Patsy.
       We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights
       who will join me in my court of Camelot.  I must speak with your lord
       and master.
   GUARD #1:  What, ridden on a horse?
   ARTHUR:  Yes!
   GUARD #1:  You're using coconuts!
   ARTHUR:  What?
   GUARD #1:  You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin'
       'em together.
   ARTHUR:  So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this
       land, through the kingdom of Mercea, through--
   GUARD #1:  Where'd you get the coconut?
   ARTHUR:  We found them.
   GUARD #1:  Found them?  In Mercea?  The coconut's tropical!
   ARTHUR:  What do you mean?
   GUARD #1:  Well, this is a temperate zone.
   ARTHUR:  The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin
       or the plumber may seek warmer climes in winter yet these are not
       strangers to our land.
   GUARD #1:  Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
   ARTHUR:  Not at all, they could be carried.
   GUARD #1:  What -- a swallow carrying a coconut?
   ARTHUR:  It could grip it by the husk!
   GUARD #1:  It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple
       question of weight ratios!  A five ounce bird could not carry a 1 pound
       coconut.
   ARTHUR:  Well, it doesn't matter.  Will you go and tell your master
       that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
   GUARD #1:  Listen, in order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow
       needs to beat its wings 43 times every second, right?
   ARTHUR:  Please!
   GUARD #1:  Am I right?
   ARTHUR:  I'm not interested!
   GUARD #2:  It could be carried by an African swallow!
   GUARD #1:  Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European
       swallow, that's my point.
   GUARD #2:  Oh, yeah, I agree with that...
   ARTHUR:  Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court
       at Camelot?!
   GUARD #1:  But then of course African swallows are not migratory.
   GUARD #2:  Oh, yeah...
   GUARD #1:  So they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway...
       [clop clop]
   GUARD #2:  Wait a minute -- supposing two swallows carried it together?
   GUARD #1:  No, they'd have to have it on a line.
   GUARD #2:  Well, simple!  They'd just use a standard creeper!
   GUARD #1:  What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
   GUARD #2:  Well, why not?

   DEAD PERSON:  I'm getting better!
   CUSTOMER:  No, you're not -- you'll be stone dead in a moment.
   MORTICIAN:  Oh, I can't take him like that -- it's against regulations.
   DEAD PERSON:  I don't want to go in the cart!
   CUSTOMER:  Oh, don't be such a baby.
   MORTICIAN:  I can't take him...
   DEAD PERSON:  I feel fine!
   CUSTOMER:  Oh, do us a favor...
   MORTICIAN:  I can't.

   CUSTOMER:  Ah, thanks very much.
   MORTICIAN:  Not at all.  See you on Thursday.
   CUSTOMER:  Right.
       [clop clop]
   MORTICIAN:  Who's that then?
   CUSTOMER:  I don't know.
   MORTICIAN:  Must be a king.
   CUSTOMER:  Why?
   MORTICIAN:  He hasn't got shit all over him.
 

Scene 3
 
       [clop clop]
   ARTHUR:  Old woman!
   DENNIS:  Man!
   ARTHUR: Old Man, sorry.  What knight live in that castle over there?
   DENNIS:  I'm thirty seven.
   ARTHUR:  What?
   DENNIS:  I'm thirty seven -- I'm not old!
   ARTHUR:  Well, I can't just call you `Man'.
   DENNIS:  Well, you could say `Dennis'.
   ARTHUR:  Well, I didn't know you were called `Dennis.'
   DENNIS:  Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you?
   ARTHUR:  I did say sorry about the `old woman,' but from the behind
       you looked--
   DENNIS:  What I object to is you automatically treat me like an inferior!
   ARTHUR:  Well, I AM king...
   DENNIS:  Oh king, eh, very nice.  An' how'd you get that, eh?  By
       exploitin' the workers -- by 'angin' on to outdated imperialist dogma
       which perpetuates the economic an' social differences in our society!
       If there's ever going to be any progress--
   WOMAN:  Dennis, there's some lovely filth down here.  Oh -- how d'you do?
   ARTHUR:  How do you do, good lady.  I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
       Who's castle is that?
   WOMAN:  King of the who?
   ARTHUR:  The Britons.
   WOMAN:  Who are the Britons?
   ARTHUR:  Well, we all are. we're all Britons and I am your king.
   WOMAN:  I didn't know we had a king.  I thought we were an autonomous
       collective.
   DENNIS:  You're fooling yourself.  We're living in a dictatorship.
       A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes--
   WOMAN:  Oh there you go, bringing class into it again.
   DENNIS:  That's what it's all about if only people would--
   ARTHUR:  Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  Who lives
       in that castle?
   WOMAN:  No one live there.
   ARTHUR:  Then who is your lord?
   WOMAN:  We don't have a lord.
   ARTHUR:  What?
   DENNIS:  I told you.  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.  We take
       it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
   ARTHUR:  Yes.
   DENNIS:  But all the decision of that officer have to be ratified
       at a special biweekly meeting.
   ARTHUR:  Yes, I see.
   DENNIS:  By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs,--
   ARTHUR:  Be quiet!
   DENNIS:  --but by a two-thirds majority in the case of more--
   ARTHUR:  Be quiet!  I order you to be quiet!
   WOMAN:  Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
   ARTHUR:  I am your king!
   WOMAN:  Well, I didn't vote for you.
   ARTHUR:  You don't vote for kings.
   WOMAN:  Well, 'ow did you become king then?
   ARTHUR:  The Lady of the Lake,
       [angels sing]
       her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur
       from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I,
       Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.
       [singing stops]
       That is why I am your king!
   DENNIS:  Listen -- strange women lying in ponds distributing swords
       is no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power
       derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical
       aquatic ceremony.
   ARTHUR:  Be quiet!
   DENNIS:  Well you can't expect to wield supreme executive power
       just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
   ARTHUR:  Shut up!
   DENNIS:  I mean, if I went around sayin' I was an empereror just
       because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me they'd
       put me away!
   ARTHUR:  Shut up!  Will you shut up!
   DENNIS:  Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system.
   ARTHUR:  Shut up!
   DENNIS:  Oh!  Come and see the violence inherent in the system!
       HELP! HELP! I'm being repressed!
   ARTHUR:  Bloody peasant!
   DENNIS:  Oh, what a give away.  Did you here that, did you here that,
       eh?  That's what I'm on about -- did you see him repressing me,
       you saw it didn't you?
 

Scene 4
 
       [arg]
       [ugh]
       [hah]
  
   ARTHUR:  You fight with the strength of many men, Sir knight.
       I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
       [pause]
       I seek the finest and the bravest knights in the land to join me
       in my Court of Camelot.
       [pause]
       You have proved yourself worthy; will you join me?
       [pause]
       You make me sad.  So be it.  Come, Patsy.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  None shall pass.
   ARTHUR:  What?
   BLACK KNIGHT:  None shall pass.
   ARTHUR:  I have no quarrel with you, good Sir knight, but I must
       cross this bridge.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Then you shall die.
   ARTHUR:  I command you as King of the Britons to stand aside!
   BLACK KNIGHT:  I move for no man.
   ARTHUR:  So be it!
       [hah]
       [parry thrust]
       [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's left arm off]
   ARTHUR:  Now stand aside, worthy adversary.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  'Tis but a scratch.
   ARTHUR:  A scratch?  Your arm's off!
   BLACK KNIGHT:  No, it isn't.
   ARTHUR:  Well, what's that then?
   BLACK KNIGHT:  I've had worse.
   ARTHUR:  You liar!
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Come on you pansy!
       [hah]
       [parry thrust]
       [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's right arm off]
   ARTHUR:  Victory is mine!
       [kneeling]
       We thank thee Lord, that in thy merc-
       [hah]
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Come on then.
   ARTHUR:  What?
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Have at you!
   ARTHUR:  You are indeed brave, Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Oh, had enough, eh?
   ARTHUR:  Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Yes I have.
   ARTHUR:  Look!
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Just a flesh wound.
       [bang]
   ARTHUR:  Look, stop that.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Chicken!  Chicken!
   ARTHUR:  Look, I'll have your leg.  Right!
       [whop]
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Right, I'll do you for that!
   ARTHUR:  You'll what?
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Come 'ere!
   ARTHUR:  What are you going to do, bleed on me?
   BLACK KNIGHT:  I'm invincible!
   ARTHUR:  You're a loony.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  The Black Knight always triumphs!
       Have at you!  Come on then.
       [whop]
       [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's other leg off]
   BLACK KNIGHT:  All right; we'll call it a draw.
   ARTHUR:  Come, Patsy.
   BLACK KNIGHT:  Oh, oh, I see, running away then.  You yellow
       bastards!  Come back here and take what's coming to you.
       I'll bite your legs off!
 

Scene 5
 
   CROWD:  A witch!  A witch!  A witch!  We've got a witch!  A witch!
   VILLAGER #1:  We have found a witch, might we burn her?
   CROWD:  Burn her!  Burn!
   BEDEMIR:  How do you know she is a witch?
   VILLAGER #2:  She looks like one.
   BEDEMIR:  Bring her forward.
   WITCH:  I'm not a witch.  I'm not a witch.
   BEDEMIR:  But you are dressed as one.
   WITCH:  They dressed me up like this.
   CROWD:  No, we didn't... no.
   WITCH:  And this isn't my nose, it's a false one.
   BEDEMIR:  Well?
   VILLAGER #1:  Well, we did do the nose.
   BEDEMIR:  The nose?
   VILLAGER #1:  And the hat -- but she is a witch!
   CROWD:  Burn her!  Witch!  Witch!  Burn her!
   BEDEMIR:  Did you dress her up like this?
   CROWD:  No, no... no ... yes.  Yes, yes, a bit, a bit.
   VILLAGER #1:  She has got a wart.
   BEDEMIR:  What makes you think she is a witch?
   VILLAGER #3:  Well, she turned me into a newt.
   BEDEMIR:  A newt?
   VILLAGER #3:  I got better.
   VILLAGER #2:  Burn her anyway!
   CROWD:  Burn!  Burn her!
   BEDEMIR:  Quiet, quiet.  Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether
       she is a witch.
   CROWD:  Are there?  What are they?
   BEDEMIR:  Tell me, what do you do with witches?
   VILLAGER #2:  Burn!
   CROWD:  Burn, burn them up!
   BEDEMIR:  And what do you burn apart from witches?
   VILLAGER #1:  More witches!
   VILLAGER #2:  Wood!
   BEDEMIR:  So, why do witches burn?
       [pause]
   VILLAGER #3:  B--... 'cause they're made of wood...?
   BEDEMIR:  Good!
   CROWD:  Oh yeah, yeah...
   BEDEMIR:  So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?
   VILLAGER #1:  Build a bridge out of her.
   BEDEMIR:  Aah, but can you not also build bridges out of stone?
   VILLAGER #2:  Oh, yeah.
   BEDEMIR:  Does wood sink in water?
   VILLAGER #1:  No, no.
   VILLAGER #2:  It floats!  It floats!
   VILLAGER #1:  Throw her into the pond!
   CROWD:  The pond!
   BEDEMIR:  What also floats in water?
   VILLAGER #1:  Bread!
   VILLAGER #2:  Apples!
   VILLAGER #3:  Very small rocks!
   VILLAGER #1:  Cider!
   VILLAGER #2:  Great gravy!
   VILLAGER #1:  Cherries!
   VILLAGER #2:  Mud!
   VILLAGER #3:  Churches -- churches!
   VILLAGER #2:  Lead -- lead!
   ARTHUR:  A duck.
   CROWD:  Oooh.
   BEDEMIR:  Exactly!  So, logically...,
   VILLAGER #1:  If... she.. weighs the same as a duck, she's made of wood.
   BEDEMIR:  And therefore--?
   VILLAGER #1:  A witch!
   CROWD:  A witch!
   BEDEMIR:  We shall use my larger scales!
       [yelling]
   BEDEMIR:  Right, remove the supports!
       [whop]
       [creak]
   CROWD:  A witch!  A witch!
   WITCH:  It's a fair cop.
   CROWD:  Burn her!  Burn!  [yelling]
   BEDEMIR:  Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
   ARTHUR:  I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
   BEDEMIR:  My liege!
   ARTHUR:  Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot,
       and join us at the Round Table?
   BEDEMIR:  My liege!  I would be honored.
   ARTHUR:  What is your name?
   BEDEMIR:  Bedemir, my leige.
   ARTHUR:  Then I dub you Sir Bedemir, Knight of the Round Table.
